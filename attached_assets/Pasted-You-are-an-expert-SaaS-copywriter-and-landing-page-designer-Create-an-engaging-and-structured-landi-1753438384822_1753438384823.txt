FAQ: List 4–5 FAQs.


Call to Action (CTA): Encourage user to sign up, request access, or download the app.


App Overview:
Metaphotolog is a powerful mobile app designed for professionals who need structured, location-aware photo documentation—whether for fieldwork, audits, surveys, or inspections. Built to work entirely offline, it empowers users to capture, organize, and export rich, geotagged photo reports without relying on internet connectivity.
The app simplifies the process of turning everyday photos into high-utility photologs with metadata, maps, and custom templates—while keeping performance, data control, and usability at its core.
Taglines (use some as hooks or within the page):

Built for fieldwork: smart capture, geotagging, and PDF export.


Media-heavy mobile app with real-time templates and local sync.
